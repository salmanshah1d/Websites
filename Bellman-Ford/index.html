	<h1>Bellman-Ford Algorithm</h1>
	<h3>Explanation</h3>
	<h2>What it Does</h2>
	<p style="width: 1250px;"> <!--Shortens paragraph to make room for image to come-->
<img src="images/bellman.jpg" style="float: right; padding-left: 40px;"/>
	The Bellman-Ford Algorithm takes a graph of V vertices and E edges a vertex from said graph. This vertex is known as the source. 

The edges (paths between two vertices) are weighted (negative or positive) and directed (explanation / applications below). 

BF traverses the graph (V - 1) iterations. It starts out with the distance from the source to itself being 0 and all other distances being infinity. The goal is to return the shortest (lowest weight) path from the source to each vertex. In each iteration, it goes through all the vertices and explores the edges extending from the vertex in question, updating the shortest path accordingly. For example, given a graph of vertices S, A, and B, if iteration 1, vertex s reveals that the first vertex (vertex S, so the source) connects to vertex A with an edge of weight 6, the shortest path known so far from S to A is 6. Then if iteration 1, vertex A reveals that there's an edge from A to B of -3, then the shortest known path so far from S to B is 3 (6-3). S to A remains unchanged. In the graphical representation below, you will explore BF traversing a somewhat complex graph. 

Please refer to "Negative-Weight Cycle" below to learn what it means and how the Bellman-Ford detects it.

	<h2>Background Knowledge</h2>
	<p3>Weighted / Shortest</p3>
	<p>The Bellman-Ford Algorithm is used on graphs with weighted edges. The purpose of it is to find the total weight of the set of edges that have the lowest collective weight from the source vertex to every other vertex (known as the shortest paths). A practical application of weighted edges might be if you're trying to find the shortest navigational distance from a source town to another. Different weights would represent distances, and the shortest path (lowest weights) would be the shortest distance.

A negative weighted distance on the other hand could represent, for example, energy absorbed or released. In a graph that the paths that a molecule can take during a chemical reaction, weights represents energy absorbed (+ve) or released (-ve) in the transition. In this case, the shortest distance might represent most heat lost.
	</p>
	<p3>Directed</p3>
	<p>In some graphs, the edge between two vertices may be only one-way. In a graph that represents navigational distance (such as to find the shortest route on an app like Uber), this would represent a one-way street.
	</p>
	<p3>Negative-Weight Cycle</p3>
	<p>If the sum of the weights of all the edges in a cycle (set of connected vertices) are negative, it represents a negative-weight cycle. This means that you can traverse through that cycle continuously and the shortest path decreases indefinitely. The Bellman-Ford Algorithm can detect whether there is a negative weight cycle present in a graph. More in the graphical representation.

Mathematically, by iteration (V-1) of Bellman-Ford, the shortest paths between the source and all vertices are found, assuming there is no negative-cycle. However, BF goes through iteration V as well, and if the shortest paths decrease further between iteration (V - 1) and (V), then BF confirms that there is a negative-weight cycle within the graph and prints that it has been detected.

	<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
	<p>O(VE), where V represents vertices and E represents edges. It traverses (V) iterations and in each iteration, it traverses through (E) edges of the graph. Hence, the time complexity is O(VE).</p>
